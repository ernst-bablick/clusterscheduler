The Grid Engine qmaster stores its configuration and actual state to a spooling
database.

As default, a Berkeley DB database is used as spooling database.
As an option, the former flat file spooling mechanism can be used by building 
Grid Engine with the aimk option -spool-classic.

The Berkeley DB comprises a database library providing database access functions
that is linked to sge_qmaster, as well as of a number of binaries for database 
maintenance.

The source code for the Berkeley DB library and tools is cloned from github.com
and is built by the cmake based build system.


Using the Berkeley DB as spooling database
==========================================

Spooling configuration and state information is done by sge_qmaster only.

The spooling database itself is no supported public interface.
Use the Grid Engine commandline or graphical interfaces to query and change
Grid Engine configuration and state information.
