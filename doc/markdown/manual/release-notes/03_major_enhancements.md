# Major Enhancements

## qconf support to add/modify/delete/show complex entries individually

`Qconf` also allows you to add, modify, delete and display complexes individually using the new `-ace`, `-Ace`, 
`-mce`, `-Mce`, `-sce` and `-scel` switches. Previously this was only possible as a group command for the whole 
complex set with `-mq`. More information can be found in the qconf(1) man page or by running `qconf -help`.
